# Why now at github?
I have no longer time to maintain uPod. Further on I've switched over to the dark side and am using iOS devices now. uPod contains to much know-how to get lost. That's why I publish the code here.

# Building uPod
uPod has been developed using Scala which has proven to be a bad choice for Android development. Though I love Scala, the Scala support on the build site for Android projects is bad and lots of the projects which where dedicated to solving this problem are no longer maintained -- especially since Kotlin has been announced as an officially supported, modern language for Android. So building uPod is an adventure -- unfortunately.

## Missing information
Some of the information in some of the build and source files is information related to private API accounts and thus has been removed by me. You can find all the missing stuff by searching for the string `???`.

## 3rd party Dependencies
Unfortunately I needed to put some of the 3rd party dependencies into the project structure to make the whole application build.

## Development Builds
For developing uPod you can build using sbt which is fast and comfortable (when it works). uPod uses [sbt-android](https://github.com/scala-android/sbt-android) for this purpose.

## Release Builds
Unfortunately I never managed it to create release builds using sbt-android. Thus for release builds you need to use gradle. I include the `gradle-android-scala-plugin` to compile the Scala code.
